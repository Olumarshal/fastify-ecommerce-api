 Data Model of ScyllaDB vs. MongoDB
ScyllaDB:

    Column-Family Data Model: Data is organized into tables with rows and columns,
    similar to a relational database but optimized for distributed storage.
    Primary Keys and Clustering Keys: Used to define data distribution and sorting within partitions.

Example Schema:
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  age INT
);

MongoDB:

    Document-Oriented Data Model: Data is stored as JSON-like documents within collections.
    Flexible Schema: Allows for dynamic and varied data structures within the same collection.

Example Schema:
{
  "name": "Kent Clark",
  "email": "kent1@example.com",
  "age": 30
}

ScyllaDB's schema is more rigid and optimized for read-heavy workloads with predictable access patterns,
while MongoDB offers more flexibility for unstructured and varied data.
