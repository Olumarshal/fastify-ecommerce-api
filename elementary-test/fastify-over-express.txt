Advantages of Using Fastify over Express.js

Performance:

    Fastify is designed for high performance, offering lower overhead and better throughput.
    Utilizes asynchronous and highly optimized internal mechanisms.

Schema-Based Validation:

    Fastify provides JSON Schema-based request and response validation out of the box, reducing the risk of runtime errors.

Developer Experience:

    Improved error handling and clearer error messages.
    More extensive plugin system and built-in support for decorators and hooks.
Example:

const fastify = require('fastify')();
fastify.get('/example', async (request, reply) => {
  return { message: 'Hello from Fastify' };
});
fastify.listen(3000, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
