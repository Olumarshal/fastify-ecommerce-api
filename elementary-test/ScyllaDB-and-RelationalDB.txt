Architectural Differences between ScyllaDB and Traditional Relational Databases

ScyllaDB:

    Distributed NoSQL Database: Designed for high availability and scalability.
    Shard-Based Architecture: Each node handles a subset of data, minimizing contention and improving performance.
    Asynchronous Replication: Provides eventual consistency with tunable consistency levels.

Relational Databases:

    ACID Transactions: Ensure strong consistency and durability.
    Centralized Architecture: Traditional RDBMS often rely on a single node or primary-replica setup,
    which can become a bottleneck.

Performance and Latency:

    ScyllaDB achieves high performance and low latency through its shard-per-core architecture,
    efficient use of system resources, and asynchronous I/O.
